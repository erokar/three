					<p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5" />
					Each night, at the end of the day:
					<ul>
						<li>Think about three good things that happened to you during the day.</li>
						<li>Reflect on your role in why they happened.</li>
						<li>Write them down in detail, including where you were and sensory detail.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The good thing can be big or small, something that brought you joy, something nice you
						did to someone, something nice someone did to you, something beautiful you saw,
						something interesting you heard. In short, anything that brought forth positive feelings
						in you. Also consider why it happened, and your role in making it happen.
					</p>
					<p>
						Try to do the excercise at approxiamtely the same time every night. This app will help
						you keep track of these things that made you happy.
					</p>
					<p>
						The practice was developed by Martin Seligman. Research has shown that it is effective
						in increasing happiness and wellbeing and reducing depression.
